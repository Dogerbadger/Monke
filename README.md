This has not been tested on any other computers. It uses PYAutoGUI and pixels.
Incorrect screen size, and it will not work.
Have not installed pytesserract? Will not work.
File paths are not corrected. Will not work.

The algorithm is simple:
It starts a game, based on input form main.py.
In CurrentGame.py, it runs the game started by main.py.
It chooses stage and strategy, and places towers according to a strategy.
It waits for money to be sufficient, and places monkeys.
It spams upgrade buttons up to the desiered upgrade.
All is done according to a strategy-function, like druidJungleWrath.
You win! Or not...
It will try again if you dont win. Indefinetly.

In the future, it would be better for performance to not check for images, but rather if a pixle is the right colour
upgrade algorithm takes a shot to visually confirm if the upgrade is done. Better to reduce amount of pixles to compare.
