This has not been tested on any other computers. It uses PYAutoGUI and pixels.
Incorrect screen sixe, and it will not work
Have not installed pytesserract? Will not work
File paths are not corrected. Will not work

The algorithm is simple:
It starts a game, based on input form main.py
In CurrentGame.py, it runs the game started by main.py
It chooses stage and strategy, and places towers according to a strategy
It waits for money to be sufficient, and places monkeys
It spams upgrade buttons up to the desiered upgrade
All is done according to a strategy-function, like druidJungleWrath.
You win! Or not...
It will try again if you dont win. Indefinetly
